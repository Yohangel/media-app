"description":"Jhayco, the artist formerly known as Jhay Cortez, feels different from the rest of the Latin music machine. He considers himself a “melody freak,” has a wide variety of influences – “Alternative music, indie music, deep house, rap, trap, salsa, bachata, scores for music” – and is intimately involved in every step of the creative process, writing, producing, and performing his brand of glossy, melancholic reggaeton.\n\nSince his breakout hit “No Me Conoce” in 2019, the Puerto Rican multihyphenate has become one of the most listened to artists in the world, thanks to collaborations with superstars including Bad Bunny and J Balvin — which have amassed several billion streams on Spotify —, along with writing credits on smash hits like Cardi B’s “I Like It” and Natti Natasha’s “Criminal.”\n\nJhayco's newest record, Le Clique: Vida Rockstar (X) is out September 6th, and is a three-part, 29-track behemoth highlighting Jhayco's globalist production style, his keen eye for melody, and his unique tastemaker status in the industry. “There's only a few people I know who do this,” he says, “and thank God I'm one of those people.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.

"description":"It seemingly a terrible time to launch an over-the-top sentimental duet. This style of production peaked in the 80s and has had few chart topping success since. But as a sort of counter programming, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' duet \"Die With A Smile\" is an unexpected smash. This oddity from two beloved legacy artists may be more than a stand alone hit hit to promote Mars' Vegas residency and Gaga's upcoming film role in Joker: Folie à Deux. \"Die With A Smile\" more than hints at being interwoven to that film's universe, while also adhering to a forgotten musical traditional: the devotional duet in the style of Sonny & Cher. In the movie, Joker and Gaga's character Harley Quinn, have shared musical delusions about performing in a murderous Sonny & Cher like TV duo. But does this single come credit sequence song stand up to the best duets from the past? Listen to find out.\n\nSongs Discussed\n\nLady Gaga & Bruno Mars - \"Die With A Smile\"\n\nSonny & Cher - \"I Got You Babe\"\n\nBread - \"Make It On Your Own\"\n\nRoberta Flack & Donny Hathaway - \"The Closer I Get To You\"\n\nLionel Richie & Diana Ross - \"Endless Love\"\n\nKenny Rogers & Dolly Parton - \"Islands in the Stream\"\n\nPatti LaBelle & Michael McDonald - \"On My Own\"\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

"description":"Few pop groups are making music as imaginative as Magdalena Bay. The Los Angeles-based duo of singer Mica Tenenbaum and multi-instrumentalist Matthew Lewin, have been steadily releasing music since 2016, eventually breaking out with their viral hit “Killshot,” four years later. In the last four years, their work has dabbled in everything from 70’s disco-pop to Y2K pastiche. Their music, often narrative-based and paired with equally stunning visuals, excels in balancing tension; there’s gossamer-sounding production juxtaposed with dark, conceptual lyrics, or chaotic cacophony placed alongside ironic euphoria.\n\nTheir sophomore album Imaginal Disk is out today, and is no exception. The record is a concept album of sorts, as it follows the story of a character named True, after receiving a “consciousness upgrade” in the form of the titular “imaginal disk.” Over the course of fifteen songs, Tenenbaum and Lewin tell a story about identity, technology, and what it means to be a human. \n\nIt’s a lofty record, so Switched On Pop’s Reanna Cruz sat down with Magdalena Bay to talk about how this album manages to sound so gorgeous — and took some cues from ABBA in the process.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

"description":"If you've spent any time on the internet this summer, you may have encountered a certain refrain accompanying particularly fierce dance videos—\"I've been a nasty girl. Nasty, nasty, nasty.\" This track, \"Nasty\" by the R&B singer and songwriter Tinashe, is a jam in its own right. Far from just a piece of viral content, \"Nasty\" is one of the songs of the summer, a chance for an burgeoning artist to reach a new level of success, and the latest in a long line pop songs from Janet Jackson to Beyoncé and Destiny's Child, taking the term \"nasty\" and spinning its on its head. \n\"Nasty\" is also a song that, in some ways, is ridiculously simple. And the simplicity of pop music has been in the news after a new scientific study argued that pop hits have become less complex over time. We dig into the study's methodology to see if we agree with its conclusion, or to put it another way, whether its conclusions match our freak.\n\nSongs Discussed \nTinashe - Nasty, Save Room For Us, 2 On\nCharli XCX - I might say something stupid\nJanet Jackson - Nasty\nDestiny's Child - Nasty Girl\nAriana Grande - Nasty\nPaul Simon - Still Crazy After all These Years\n\nMore\nRead more from the New York Times about the study exploring pop's melodic complexity through history.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

"description":"On June 17 the pop world was rocked by three letters: LOL. Kesha tweeted the acronym immediately after Katy Perry announced her new single \"Woman's World,\" which was co-written by Dr. Luke. Since Kesha had accused Dr. Luke of sexual assault a decade earlier, many read her \"LOL\" as directed at her one-time friend Perry. Kesha, meanwhile, released her own single a week before Perry's, a wild \"Joyride\" featuring hyperactive accordion, percussive handclaps, and quasi-operatic vocals.\nBoth pop stars have much at stake with their new songs. For Kesha, it's her first independent release since finishing her multi album contract with Dr. Luke's record label. For Katy Perry, it's her attempt to reconquer the charts after her last attempt fizzled. On this episode, we listen closely to both songs to hear how each artist is navigating a pivotal moment in their career.\nSince we are talking about the changing eras of some of our biggest stars, we knew we had to speak to an expert on the subject: Tayla Parx, the singer and songwriter whose newest track \"Era\" considers the tension between letting the moment define you, or defining it yourself.\n\nSongs Discussed:\nKesha - Joyride, Tik Tok, Eat the Acid, Raising Hell, Praying\nKaty Perry - Womans World, I Kissed a Girl, California Gurls, Daisies\nLady Gaga - Born This Way\nMadonna - Express Yourself\nTayla Parx - Era\nLearn more about your ad choices.

This club record celebrating messiness, partying, and brutal honesty has created its own color (brat green), a viral meme generator, and even an unlikely political platform. When CharliXCX endorsed Kamala Harris for president, saying \"Kamala IS brat\", the album took on a larger culture significance. The pundit class rushed to explain what it means to be a brat. Countless ink has been spilled dissecting the artwork and semiotics of brat, but has everyone really listened to the music?

"description":"For decades, hip hop has been the most successful genre on the charts. Then, in 2023, a shift occurred. For the first time, the country songs outnumbered hip hop songs on the year end charts. Last year, country’s boom was led by hyper-partisan hits like Jason Aldean’s “Try That In A Small Town” and Oliver Anthony’s “Rich Men North of Richmond.” In 2024, country has taken a left turn. Beyoncé’s genre-busting album Cowboy Carter pushed the limits of what country can sound like, and who can make it. Two of her collaborators have since charted #1 hits: Shaboozey with “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” and Post Malone with “I Had Some Help” featuring Morgan Wallen. Country music is growing, and its sound is changing. Will it replace hip hop for good? \nLearn more about your ad choices.

"description":"In today’s volatile music industry, many artists struggle to navigate the pitfalls of touring, the whims of social media, and the inequity of exploitative contracts. But Lawrence, an eight-piece band led by siblings Clyde and Gracie Lawrence, provide a beacon of hope.

"description":"The first half of 2024 has been for the “pop girlie.” It seems like every major artist who’s dominated the discourse this year has been a woman, ostensibly making music about what it means to be a woman. There’s Camila Cabello's \"Chanel no.5,” Lorde and Charli XCX working out the labyrinth of emotions that come with female friendship on the “Girl, so confusing” remix, and Sabrina Carpenter’s ode to the female ego, “Please Please Please.\" On this episode, Charlie, Nate, and Reanna – with some insight from journalist Ilana Kaplan – unpack these tracks at length, exploring what these artists are saying about femininity, and by extension, themselves.\n\nSongs discussed:\n\nCamila Cabello – Chanel No.5\n\nCamila Cabello – I LUV IT (ft.

Nobody knows this better than lifelong L.A. resident Lorely Rodriguez, also known as Empress Of. The indie-pop darling’s latest record, aptly titled For Your Consideration, is her take on what it means to have your full self considered, in all of its guises. The almost genreless record is so wildly catchy and remarkable in scope (all of the percussion on the record is actually Rodriguez’s voice) that Switched On Pop host Nate Sloan and producer Reanna Cruz had to consider For Your Consideration with Empress Of herself, live in person, in the City of Angels.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

"description":"There is no contemporary pop music without Nile Rodgers. Born in 1952, Rodgers grew up playing classical music on flute and clarinet before picking up jazz guitar. And at age 20, alongside bass player Bernard Edwards, Rodgers formed the band Chic. They wrote the biggest disco hits of the 70s, like: “Dance Dance Dance,” “Everybody Dance,” “Le Freak,\" and \"Good TImes,\" which formed the core of Sugarhill Gang’s “Rapper's Delight”.\nIn his music career spanning six decades, Rodgers has produced and played on some of the biggest pop songs in history, for artists like Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, David Bowie, Madonna, Daft Punk, and Beyoncé. He is also the chair of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, so with the Songwriters Hall of Fame ceremony taking place this June, we invited him onto Switched on Pop to talk about the making of a great song.\nLearn more about your ad choices.

After three albums, billions of streams, and numerous songwriting credits – including one on the award-winning number one track “Stay” from the Kid Laroi – Puth has been busier than ever. His new song “Hero” comes on the heels of the Swift mention, and takes him in a new direction, with acoustic guitars and hushed, contemplative vocals.\nOn the heels of this song’s release, Nate sat down with Charlie Puth himself at Conway Studios in Hollywood to discuss the new track, aided by a piano and all of “Hero”’s isolated stems.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
